## Goal

The goal of the LOLESXi project is to identify, track, and document native VMware ESXi binaries and scripts that adversaries utilise during offensive campaigns. By cataloging these tools, the project aims to raise awareness and provide information to enhance detection capabilities.

## Criteria

* Be natively available in VMWARE ESXi.
* Have been documented via CTI or open source offensive security content.

Interesting functionality can include:

* Terminate Process
* Lists VMs
* Terminate Running VM
* System Information
* Account Enumeration
* Find Files
* Remove Evidence
* Find and Replace
* Change File Permission
* Discover storage
* Enable Service
* Disable Startup
* Inhibit Recovery
* Power off VM
* Stop Service
* Adjust Performance
* Replace File
* Timestomp
* Change Display Information
* Disable Service
* Discover Network Info
* Software Operation

## The History of the LOLBin

The phrase "Living off the land" was coined by Christopher Campbell (@obscuresec) & Matt Graeber (@mattifestation) at [DerbyCon 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-r6UonEkUw).

## The History about this project

The inspiration to create this project is based on the session [Defending and Investigating Hypervisors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJwc_UgzbO4) by Anurag Khanna and Thirumalai Natarajan at the SANS DFIR Summit 2023.
