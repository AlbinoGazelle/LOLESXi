LoLESXi is a curated compilation of binaries available in VMware ESXi that are were used to by adversaries in their operations. This project gathers procedural examples from public reports of adversarial activities targeting ESXi hosts and offers an interface for the broader cyber defence community to search and  learn through these examples.
<br><br> This project is a collaborative project. Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/wietze">@wietze</a> and the <a href="https://lolbas-project.github.io/">LOLBAS project</a> for the theme.
